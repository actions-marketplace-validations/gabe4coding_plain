 * Run modes and lock files (docs/running.mdx "Run modes"). A passing run records what each step needed from Jev:
 * the locator of every picked element, and for every claim a hash of the state Jev judged true. One sidecar per
 * source file (`login.yaml` → `login.lock.json`), committed next to the specs.
 *   judge         Jev picks and judges every step; a passing attempt writes the lock.
 *   no-judge      no Jev call: a pick replays its locator, a claim passes only on its recorded state. A miss is
 *                 inconclusive. Never writes.
 *   auto-healing  a pick replays its locator; Jev picks when the locator misses or the step fails with it, and the
 *                 healed locator is written when the attempt passes. Jev judges every claim.
 * The lock holds no secret and no run data: a claim keeps a hash only, and every value a run filled in is written
 * back as its placeholder (src/core/parameters.ts), in keys, locators and the hashed states alike.
