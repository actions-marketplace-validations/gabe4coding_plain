plain runs natural-language YAML specs on three engines: browser (`src/browser/`), desktop (`src/computer/`) and
mobile (`src/mobile/`); desktop and mobile share `src/native/`. Playwright or the native adapter acts; Jev
(TypeSafe's model) is the only decision maker.

## Validation (mandatory)

Before any pull request, and before you report a change as done, follow the `validating-changes` skill
(`.claude/skills/validating-changes/SKILL.md`).

```
npm run build               # src/ → dist/; after a clone and after each src/ change
npm test                    # build + node --test 'dist/**/*.test.js' 'scripts/*.test.mjs'; needs no Jev key
npm run verify              # the key-free gate CI runs: tests, docs, examples, plugins
node scripts/validate.mjs   # the whole validation loop + the pre-PR stamp
```

## Rules for every task

- The repo is site-agnostic: site-specific skills, environment facts and regression specs go in downstream plugins.
- No literal credentials in any spec, doc YAML included: `$VAR` in the `env` block, `${env.*}` in steps.
- When you drive a site: test environments only, stop before the last irreversible step (payment, booking,
  sending), never bypass bot protection.
